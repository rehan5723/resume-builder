# Resume Builder Web App (Frontend & UI/UX Prototype)

LINK TO THE LIVE PROJECT - https://resume-builder-eta-tan.vercel.app/login



## Project Overview
This is a **Resume Builder Web Application** designed to help users create professional resumes quickly and efficiently.  
Currently, this project focuses **only on the frontend and UI/UX design** due to time constraints. The backend and database integration are yet to be implemented.

The application provides a clean and intuitive interface for:

- Selecting resume templates
- Adding personal information, education, projects, skills, certifications, and experience
- Previewing the resume in real-time
- Responsive design compatible with both desktop and mobile

This project is built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern frontend practices.
